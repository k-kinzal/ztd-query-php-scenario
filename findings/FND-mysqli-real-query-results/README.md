# FND-mysqli-real-query-results

Applications that use `real_query()` followed by `store_result()` (buffered) or `use_result()` (unbuffered) get `true` from `real_query()` on `ZtdMysqli` but `false` from both result methods for a SELECT, where native `mysqli` returns a `mysqli_result` with the rows. `query()` on the same SQL works.

## Reproduce

From the repository root with PHP 8.1+, `mysqli` and an empty disposable MySQL database:

```bash
composer install
ZTD_MYSQL_HOST=127.0.0.1 ZTD_MYSQL_PORT=3306 ZTD_MYSQL_DB=test ZTD_MYSQL_USER=root ZTD_MYSQL_PASSWORD=root \
  php findings/FND-mysqli-real-query-results/repro.php
```

The script runs the same operations on a native `mysqli` connection (physical table, dropped afterwards) and on a `ZtdMysqli` (session-only table) and prints one JSON line per comparison; exit 1 means at least one divergence. Retained outputs: PHP 8.5.8 and 8.1.34 on MySQL 8.0.46 in `cycles/2026/09/CYC-20260926T200050738102Z-mysqli-native-parity/repro/real-query-results-php8*-output.txt`; scenario runs in `cycles/2026/09/CYC-20260926T200050738102Z-mysqli-native-parity/runs/`.

Classification: existing problem on the current baseline (`BASE-20260926-main-aac51e9`, package set unchanged by upstream 249944e). Introduction point unknown; not attributed to any recent upstream change.
