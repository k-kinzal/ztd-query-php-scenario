# FND-mysqli-stmt-init

Older `mysqli` code prepares statements with `$stmt = $mysqli->stmt_init(); $stmt->prepare($sql);`. On `ZtdMysqli` this path fails with `mysqli_sql_exception` 1146 (table does not exist) for a table created in the session, while `ZtdMysqli::prepare()` for the same SQL works.

## Reproduce

From the repository root with PHP 8.1+, `mysqli` and an empty disposable MySQL database:

```bash
composer install
ZTD_MYSQL_HOST=127.0.0.1 ZTD_MYSQL_PORT=3306 ZTD_MYSQL_DB=test ZTD_MYSQL_USER=root ZTD_MYSQL_PASSWORD=root \
  php findings/FND-mysqli-stmt-init/repro.php
```

The script runs the same operations on a native `mysqli` connection (physical table, dropped afterwards) and on a `ZtdMysqli` (session-only table) and prints one JSON line per comparison; exit 1 means at least one divergence. Retained outputs: PHP 8.5.8 and 8.1.34 on MySQL 8.0.46 in `cycles/2026/09/CYC-20260926T200050738102Z-mysqli-native-parity/repro/stmt-init-php8*-output.txt`; scenario runs in `cycles/2026/09/CYC-20260926T200050738102Z-mysqli-native-parity/runs/`.

Classification: existing problem on the current baseline (`BASE-20260926-main-aac51e9`, package set unchanged by upstream 249944e). Introduction point unknown; not attributed to any recent upstream change.
